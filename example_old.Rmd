## Summary
In this tutorial, I will explain how we can use clustering techniques to create
ratings groups. Then I will plot the newly created groups. Also like most the 
credit goes to [Sam Tyner](https://twitter.com/sctyner) for inspiring this and 
helping with a good amount of the code.



## Libraries
Here are some of the libraries I'll be using throughout the example; most of 
this relies on the tidyverse (classic).

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
library(kableExtra)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
```

## Data
The data comes from [IMBD](www.imdb.com). I will be looking at The Office episode
ratings. I have decided not to publish the code for this as it's a little 
dubious whether I'm allowed to or not.

```{r functions, echo=FALSE}

get_airdate <- function(html){
  html %>% 
    html_nodes(".info") %>% 
    html_nodes("div.airdate") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    str_trim() %>% 
    str_remove_all("[:punct:]") %>% 
    parse_date(format = "%d %b %Y")
}

get_title <- function(html){
  html %>% 
    html_nodes(".info") %>% 
    html_nodes("strong") %>% 
    html_text()
}

get_rating <- function(html){
  html %>% 
    html_nodes(".info") %>% 
    html_node("span.ipl-rating-star__rating") %>% 
    html_text() %>% parse_number()
}

get_nvotes <- function(html){
  html %>% 
    html_nodes(".info") %>% 
    html_nodes("span.ipl-rating-star__total-votes") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    parse_number()
}
  
get_desc <- function(html){
  html %>% 
    html_nodes(".info") %>% 
    html_node("div.item_description") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    str_trim()
}

get_ep_info <- function(html){
  tibble(title = get_title(html), 
         airdate = get_airdate(html),
         descr = get_desc(html), 
         rating = get_rating(html),
         nvotes = get_nvotes(html))
}

get_rating_score <- function(r, bnd){
  score <- rep(F, length(r))
  for (i in 1:(length(bnd)-1)){
    score[between(r, bnd[i], bnd[i+1])] <- c("Garbage", "Bad", "Average", "Great", "Perfect")[i]
  }
  return(score)
}

```


```{r get_data, echo=FALSE}
url <- "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/episodes?season={season}"

url_list <- tibble(season = 1:9) %>% 
  glue_data(url)

all_episodes <- tibble(season = 1:9, url = url_list) %>% 
  mutate(html = map(url, read_html))

all_episodes <- all_episodes %>% 
  mutate(info = map(html, get_ep_info))


all_episodes <- all_episodes %>% 
  select(season, info) %>% 
  unnest(c(info)) %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  arrange(airdate) %>% 
  mutate(ep_no = row_number()) %>% 
  select(season, ep_no, title:nvotes)

```

Let see what the data looks like.
```{r data_sample}
head(all_episodes) %>%
  select(-descr) %>%
  kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

Here is a histogram of the ratings for every episode.
```{r data_sample_plot}
all_episodes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=rating)) + 
    geom_histogram() + 
    theme_bw()
```

Ideally we'd like to categorize each episode into one of five groups:

 - Perfect ![alt text](http://i.redd.it/lw9m6l93a0p11.jpg)

 - Great ![alt text](http://www.theofficequotes.com/screenshots/8720d27b175709b74aae811df2ed8158.jpg)

 - Average ![alt text](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/02/b0/5402b09ba1ffcfb356627b25346c0936.jpg)

 - Bad ![alt text](http://media1.tenor.com/images/e3d250d45b8d3d386473ba0dc28925e1/tenor.gif)

 - Garbage ![Alt Text](http://i.pinimg.com/736x/4c/e2/40/4ce240e68f3a770b08f5445ff8fa4e68.jpg)




There isn't much data here but lets try a basic k-means clusting algorithm.
```{r cluster_ratings}
set.seed(808)
cratings <- kmeans(all_episodes %>% select(season, ep_no, rating, nvotes) %>% na.omit() %>% scale(), 5, nstart = 25)

all_episodes <- all_episodes %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(clust_score = cratings$cluster)
```

Here some plots of the clusters.
```{r cluster_plot}
fviz_cluster(cratings, geom = "point",  data = all_episodes %>% select(season, ep_no, rating, nvotes) %>% na.omit() %>% scale())

all_episodes %>% 
  select(season, ep_no, rating, nvotes, clust_score) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rating, y=ep_no, color = factor(clust_score), label = season)) +
    geom_text()
```

So as we can see from the plots some of the groups are seperated by episode 
number. Since I included that in the data.frame to be used in the clustering 
algorithm, the algrithm assumed it was a meaningful variable to seperate on. 
I think it would be interesting to see how it would clusted based soley on the 
rating and number of votes. Let's try that.

```{r cluster_ratings2}
set.seed(808)
cratings <- kmeans(all_episodes %>% select(rating, nvotes) %>% na.omit() %>% scale(), 5, nstart = 25)

all_episodes <- all_episodes %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(clust_score2 = cratings$cluster)
```

Here some plots of the clusters. It no longer depends on the episode number 
which is good.

```{r cluster_plot2}
fviz_cluster(cratings, geom = "point",  data = all_episodes %>% select(rating, nvotes) %>% na.omit() %>% scale())

all_episodes %>% 
  select(season, ep_no, rating, nvotes, clust_score, clust_score2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rating, y=ep_no, color = factor(clust_score2), label = season)) +
    geom_text()

all_episodes %>% 
  select(season, ep_no, rating, nvotes, clust_score, clust_score2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rating, y=nvotes, color = factor(clust_score2), label = season)) +
    geom_text()
```


So I'd like to see how it would compare to a fixed grouping using quantiles.
```{r make_basic_clusters}
bnds = quantile(all_episodes$rating, 0:5/5)

all_episodes <- all_episodes %>%
  mutate(fixed_score = get_rating_score(rating, bnd=bnds), 
                        # levels = c("Garbage", "Bad", "Average", "Great", "Perfect"), 
                        # ordered = T),
         clust_score = recode_factor(clust_score2,
                                            '1' = "Garbage", 
                                            '5' = "Bad", 
                                            '3' = "Average", 
                                            '2' = "Great", 
                                            '4' = "Perfect"))

```

Here is the plot! The first observation is the clustering algrithm is more 
choosy about which episodes are in the higher rating categories. Since the 
clustering algorithm is taking the number of votes into account, it allows for
certain ratings to blend when they look like the otherwise shouldn't.
```{r final_cluster_plots}
all_episodes %>%
  select(season, ep_no, airdate, rating, nvotes, clust_score, fixed_score) %>%
  gather(grptype, grpng, -season, -ep_no, -airdate, -rating, -nvotes) %>%
  mutate(grpng = factor(grpng, c("Perfect", "Great", "Average", "Bad", "Garbage")),
         grptype = recode_factor(grptype,
                                 'clust_score' = 'Clusters',
                                 'fixed_score' = 'Quantiles')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=airdate, y=rating, color=grpng)) + 
    geom_point(size=3) + theme_bw() + 
    facet_grid(~grptype) + 
    labs(x="Airdate", y="Rating", color="Rating Group")
```
