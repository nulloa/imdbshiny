## Summary
In this tutorial, I will explain how we can use clustering techniques to create
ratings groups. Then I will plot the newly created groups. Also like most the 
credit goes to [Sam Tyner](https://twitter.com/sctyner) for inspiring this and 
helping with a good amount of the code.


You'll need this install this package: `devtools::install_github("rmhogervorst/imdb")`.
This package is pretty cool. Learn more about it on [github](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/imdb).


## Libraries
Here are some of the libraries I'll be using throughout the example; most of 
this relies on the tidyverse (classic).

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(imdb)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
```

## Data
The data comes from [IMBD](www.imdb.com). I will be looking at The Office episode
ratings. See [here](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/imdb) for more info on how to get the data.

```{r functions}

get_rating_score <- function(r, bnd){
  score <- rep(F, length(r))
  for (i in 1:(length(bnd)-1)){
    score[between(r, bnd[i], bnd[i+1])] <- c("Garbage", "Bad", "Average", "Great", "Perfect")[i]
  }
  return(score)
}

```


```{r get_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
all_episodes = imdbSeries(seriesname = "The Office", seasons = 1:9) %>% 
  left_join(enrichIMDB(.) %>% select(imdbID, director, runtime, votes))
```

Let see what the data looks like.
```{r data_sample}
head(all_episodes) %>%
  kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

I'd like to look at runtime numerically so I will convert that.
```{r data_manip}
all_episodes <- all_episodes %>% mutate(runtime = readr::parse_number(runtime))
```


Here is a histogram of the ratings for every episode broken down by season.
```{r data_sample_plot}
all_episodes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=imdbRating)) + 
    geom_histogram() +
    facet_wrap(~Season) +
    theme_bw()
```

Ideally we'd like to categorize each episode into one of five groups:

 - Perfect ![alt text](http://i.redd.it/lw9m6l93a0p11.jpg)

 - Great ![alt text](http://www.theofficequotes.com/screenshots/8720d27b175709b74aae811df2ed8158.jpg)

 - Average ![alt text](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/02/b0/5402b09ba1ffcfb356627b25346c0936.jpg)

 - Bad ![alt text](http://media1.tenor.com/images/e3d250d45b8d3d386473ba0dc28925e1/tenor.gif)

 - Garbage ![Alt Text](http://i.pinimg.com/736x/4c/e2/40/4ce240e68f3a770b08f5445ff8fa4e68.jpg)




There isn't much data here but lets try a basic k-means clusting algorithm.
```{r cluster_ratings}

colSums(!is.na(all_episodes)) > nrow(all_episodes)*.75

set.seed(808)
if(length(unique(all_episodes$Season))==1){
  cratings <- kmeans(all_episodes %>% select_if(colSums(!is.na(.)) > nrow(.)*.75) %>% select(-director, -imdbID, -Title, -Season, -Released) %>% na.omit() %>% scale(), 5, nstart = 25)
}else{
  cratings <- kmeans(all_episodes %>% select_if(colSums(!is.na(.)) > nrow(.)*.75) %>% select(-director, -imdbID, -Title, -Released) %>% na.omit() %>% scale(), 5, nstart = 25)
}


all_episodes <- all_episodes %>%
  left_join(all_episodes %>%
  select_if(colSums(!is.na(.)) > nrow(.)*.75) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(clust_score = cratings$cluster))
```

Here some plots of the clusters.
```{r cluster_plot}
fviz_cluster(cratings, geom = "point",  data = all_episodes %>% 
                                                 select(imdbRating, Episode, Season, runtime, votes) %>% 
                                                 na.omit() %>% 
                                                 scale())

all_episodes %>% 
  select(imdbRating, Episode, Season, runtime, votes, clust_score) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=imdbRating, y=Episode, color = factor(clust_score), label = Season)) +
    geom_text()

all_episodes %>% 
  select(imdbRating, Episode, Season, runtime, votes, clust_score) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=imdbRating, y=Season, color = factor(clust_score), label = Episode)) +
    geom_text()

all_episodes %>% 
  select(imdbRating, Episode, Season, runtime, votes, clust_score) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=imdbRating, y=runtime, color = factor(clust_score), label = Episode)) +
    geom_text()
```


So I'd like to see how it would compare to a fixed grouping using quantiles.
```{r make_basic_clusters}
bnds = quantile(all_episodes$imdbRating, 0:5/5)

if(any(is.na(all_episodes$clust_score))){
  grps = c("Garbage", "Bad", "Average", "Great", "Perfect", NA)
}else{
  c("Garbage", "Bad", "Average", "Great", "Perfect")
}


mmclustrat <- all_episodes %>%
  group_by(clust_score) %>%
  summarise(mnrat = mean(imdbRating)) %>%
  arrange(mnrat) %>%
  cbind(., grps)

all_episodes <- all_episodes %>%
  left_join(mmclustrat) %>%
  mutate(clust_score = grps) %>%
  select(-grps, -mnrat) %>%
  mutate(fixed_score = get_rating_score(imdbRating, bnd=bnds))
                        # levels = c("Garbage", "Bad", "Average", "Great", "Perfect"), 
                        # ordered = T),

```

Here is the plot! The first observation is the clustering algrithm is more 
choosy about which episodes are in the higher rating categories. Since the 
clustering algorithm is taking the number of votes into account, it allows for
certain ratings to blend when they look like the otherwise shouldn't.
```{r final_cluster_plots}
p <- all_episodes %>%
  select(-imdbID, -director) %>%
  gather(clustertype, Rating, -Season, -Episode, -Released, -imdbRating, -votes, -runtime, -Title) %>%
  mutate(Rating = factor(Rating, c("Perfect", "Great", "Average", "Bad", "Garbage")),
         clustertype = recode_factor(clustertype,
                                 'clust_score' = 'Clusters',
                                 'fixed_score' = 'Quantiles')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Released, y=imdbRating)) + 
    geom_point(aes(text=paste("Title:", Title), color=Rating), size=3) + theme_bw() + 
    facet_grid(clustertype~.) + 
    labs(x="Airdate", y="Rating", color="Rating Group") + 
    theme(legend.position="bottom")

plotly::ggplotly(p)
```
